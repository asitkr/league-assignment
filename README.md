# Inspiration & Difficulties
In this project first I have to think and learned about the structure and layout of web Application.After that I learned how to Fetch a data and apply filteration to that.Then i think how to access  a data while offline and give us Pop-up.In this I also learned about various hooks and some more property of a CSS and designing the front-end part also.Thankyou
